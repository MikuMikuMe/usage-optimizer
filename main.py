Sure, I can help you create a basic Python program to monitor and optimize energy consumption for smart homes. This program will simulate the monitoring and optimizing process by predicting usage patterns and suggesting improvements. For a real-world scenario, integration with IoT devices and a database for data storage would be needed.

Here's a basic prototype:

```python
import random
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class SmartHome:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.energy_usage = {'lights': 0, 'heating': 0, 'cooling': 0, 'appliances': 0}
        self.optimization_suggestions = []

    def simulate_usage(self):
        """Simulate energy usage typically between 100 and 500 units for each category."""
        try:
            self.energy_usage = {category: random.randint(100, 500) for category in self.energy_usage}
            logging.info(f"{self.name} Usage Simulated: {self.energy_usage}")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error simulating usage for {self.name}: {e}")

    def analyze_usage(self):
        """Analyze current usage pattern and make suggestions."""
        try:
            total_usage = sum(self.energy_usage.values())
            logging.info(f'Total energy usage for {self.name}: {total_usage} units.')

            if total_usage > 1500:  # Threshold for optimization suggestions
                self.optimization_suggestions = [
                    "Consider using energy-efficient light bulbs.",
                    "Improve insulation to reduce heating/cooling costs.",
                    "Unplug appliances when not in use.",
                    "Use programmable thermostats to optimize heating/cooling."
                ]
                logging.info(f"Optimization Suggestions for {self.name}: {self.optimization_suggestions}")
            else:
                logging.info(f"{self.name} usage is optimal. No suggestions required.")
        
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error analyzing usage for {self.name}: {e}")

    def show_suggestions(self):
        """Display optimization suggestions."""
        if self.optimization_suggestions:
            print(f"Optimization Suggestions for {self.name}:")
            for suggestion in self.optimization_suggestions:
                print(f"- {suggestion}")
        else:
            print(f"No suggestions for {self.name}, energy usage is optimal.")

def main():
    try:
        # Create a SmartHome instance
        home = SmartHome("John's Smart Home")
        
        # Simulate and analyze home energy usage
        home.simulate_usage()
        home.analyze_usage()
        
        # Show suggestions based on analysis
        home.show_suggestions()
        
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred in the main function: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

- **Logging**: This program uses Python's `logging` library to log information at different levels (INFO, ERROR).

- **SmartHome Class**:
  - Contains `simulate_usage`, `analyze_usage`, and `show_suggestions` methods.
  - `simulate_usage` method generates random energy usage for different categories.
  - `analyze_usage` method evaluates if energy consumption exceeds a certain threshold and prepares optimization suggestions if needed.
  - `show_suggestions` method prints out any optimization suggestions.

- **Error Handling**: Each method has a try-except block to catch and log errors, ensuring that the application does not crash on unexpected input or conditions.

This basic version only simulates energy usage and gives static suggestions. For a real-world application, you would use actual data from smart home devices and potentially integrate machine learning to better analyze and predict energy patterns.
